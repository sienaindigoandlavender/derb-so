        "content": "Morocco has a *taxe de séjour* — a city tax on overnight stays, charged per person, per night. For riads and guesthouses it runs around 25 MAD (roughly €2.50 per person). Luxury hotels pay more — up to 30+ MAD depending on classification and city. Children under 12 skip it entirely. It's a government levy under Law 30-89, collected by every licensed accommodation and funnelled to the municipality for tourism infrastructure. Completely legitimate. Not negotiable."
      },
      {
        "content": "Some properties include the tax in their room rate. Others don't. And there's no rule about which approach to take. So a room listed at €80 might mean €80 total at one riad and €80 plus €5 per person per night at another. For a couple staying four nights, that's a €40 difference materialising at the worst possible moment — when you're trying to leave for the airport."

      {
        "content": "Booking confirmations usually mention *taxe de séjour*, *city tax*, or *local tax*. If you spot \"exclusive of local taxes\" in the fine print, that's your cue. If nothing is mentioned, a quick message to your host before arrival clears it up in seconds. The tax is usually paid in cash — dirhams — at check-in or check-out. No drama required."

Some properties fold it into the room rate; others add it at checkout, which is when most people discover it exists. It's a government levy under Law 30-89 — the equivalent of a city tax you'd find in most European capitals.",
